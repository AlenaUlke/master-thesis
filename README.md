# Master's Thesis
This repository contains the source code to solve the proof-of-concept example presented in my master's thesis entitled ***Traffic Emission Models: Simulation and Optimization***. 

The code also provides the numerical treatment of speed-limit-dependent traffic emission models, which includes the discretization of the 
Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model and advection-diffusion-type equations with mixed boundary conditions on a two-dimensional domain.
