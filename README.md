# Master Thesis
This repository contains the source code to solve the proof-of-concept example presented in my master thesis entitled ***Traffic Emission Models: Simulation and Optimization***. 
The thesis was also pubished as an research article in *Springer Optimization and Engeneering*:

S. GÃ¶ttlich, M. Herty & A. Ulke *Speed limits in traffic emission models using multi-objective optimization*. Optim Eng (2024). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11081-024-09894-4

The code also provides the numerical treatment of speed-limit-dependent traffic emission models, which includes the discretization of the 
Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model and advection-diffusion-type equations with mixed boundary conditions on a two-dimensional domain.
